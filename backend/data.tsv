b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	09/06/2024	5	Dev omgeving ingesteld, django django en react runnen.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	12/06/2024	3	Added chatGPT4o_api in the syntethic app. It contains one simple example api request to chatgtp4o with the first bullish headline prompt of the headlines class.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	14/06/2024	2	I Altered main.py to generate text with gpt instead of mistral. I also altered the template prompt to get cleaner generated text. Furthermore I improved the gpt_api.py file, now it can be imported within any other python file and be used the generate text with it.- What is left is just to generate the articles. When this is done I will update the google drive data.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	15/06/2024	0,5	Finished generating the synthetic articles and added these to the Google drive.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	17/06/2024	3	Currently generating new articles based on the “article_formats“. This picture is an example of the similarity between an article without an specificly asked format and the reuters format. I also build in a check such that only new articles are generated when the prompt combined with a article Format does not yet exist.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	18/06/2024	4,5	I created 16 “formats“ to generate different articles on the pre-defined headlines. 13 of them have been generated, around 3300 articles now. I also created a similarity check based on tfidf and cosine similarity. I will finish generating tomorrow, and will create a similarity matrix comparing all the different formats to eachother, to in the end filter bad articles.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	19/06/2024	2	Bugs uit de similarity check en de headlines functie, sommige headlines kwamen twee keer voor of er was een komma vergeten.

b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	04/07/2024	4	Added fed app to django to handle Fed tsv import and table migration to news. Scripts to import tsv and move fed articles from fed table to news table have been made.
b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	05/07/2024	3	Added all new scraped topics as apps in django including import and migrate scripts. Also altered front end to show articles based on date instead of just db order.

b3f72aecdf6241e5816bb2ea4a1e7769	06/09/2024	2,5	I fixed this item. I added a new condition in fetchNewsAll that includes the text filter. This way all GUI features act as one big AND condition. 1 small problem, the current code on this functionality can be simplified due to duplicate features existing in both app.tsx and useSearchBar.tsx. For now the filter works, we can Refactor the code later on if needed.
